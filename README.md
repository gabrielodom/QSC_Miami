## Introduction

This directory contains all of my software teaching notes for the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center's *Quantitative Science Clinics* R lecture series at the University of Miami. I gave the **R for Data Science** summary lectures during the spring and summer of 2018, and the other lessons as the faculty requested them.


## Overview
### R Intro Material Overview
The Quantitative Science Clinics for the spring of 2018 will have a series of four interactive lectures on Data Exploration in R. We will base these four lectures on the first section of Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund’s R for Data Science (Part I: “Explore”). Similar to the order of the book, we will present the information as follows:

1. **Session 1, 16 January**. An introduction to data visualization with the `ggplot` and `ggmap` packages. Assuming the attendees have little experience in `R` code, this session will work through the basics of simple data visualizations to explore relationships between features. This presentation will cover an introduction to the tidy data format, the basic structure of a `ggplot2` plot, and powerful techniques for turning tidy data into plots.
2. **Session 2, 20 February**. An introduction to the data analysis workflow in `R` using the RStudio integrated development environment. This session starts from the basics of `R` object assignment, naming, and calling, build up to scripting and basic diagnostics, and finish with script and data organization with R project files. This session will enable attendees to efficiently organize their data analysis work.
3. **Session 3, 20 March**. An introduction to data manipulation and transformation with the `dplyr` package. This session will cover various techniques to efficiently order, subset, summarize, filter, and transform your data for easier visualization and summarization. We will also briefly discuss data import and export using the `readr` package in conjunction with the RStudio interface.
4. **Session 4, 17 April**. A start-to-finish walkthrough of basic exploratory data analysis using the tidyverse package suite. Combing all the tools and techniques we’ve covered in the first three sessions, we will create a data exploration report from scratch and save our work as a portable project. 

Due to the computational nature of the lectures, attendees are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop in order to follow along with the examples.


### Package Development
The Quantitative Science Clinics for the summer of 2018 will have a series of three interactive lectures on Collaborative Package Development in R. We will present the information as follows:

1. **Session 1, 3 May**. My First R Package
2. **Session 2, 24 May**. Collaborative Development I: Project Organization and Style
3. **Session 3, 7 June**. Collaborative Development II: Version Control with GitHub
