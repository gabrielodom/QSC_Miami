# Introduction
These notes are designed to act as a gentle introduction to some data transformation and manipulation possibilities using the suite of `R` packages known as the `tidyverse`. We assume the user already has some very basic understanding of executing `R` code and using the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) integrated development environment (IDE). The examples and layout of this chapter are drawn directly from chapter five of Grolemund and Wickham's text, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). We strongly recommend this book.

## The `tidyverse` Suite
We first load the `tidyverse` package suite. 
```{r pack_load}
library(tidyverse)
```

This suite contains the following packages:

- `dplyr`: a "pair of pliers" for tidy `data.frame` objects
- `forcats`: a set of tools "for cat-" egorical variables, i.e. `factor` variables
- `ggplot2`: plotting with the "layered **G**rammar of **G**raphics"
- `purrr`: a functional programming toolkit to make your functions "purr" over lists
- `readr`: read data into `R`
- `stringr`: do things with strings
- `tibble`: create the `table + data.frame` joint class, or `tbl_df` (pronounced "tibble")
- `tidyr`: "tidy-up" your raw data

We are discussing transforming and manipulating *tidy* data frames today, so we will take a closer look at the `dplyr` package.


## Review
We saw the power of the `ggplot2` packge in action in our January seminar. In the February seminar, we discussed the object-oriented basics of `R` code, how to organise and document your code in scripts, and how to organise your scripts into a project. Here are some cheat sheets and other helpful links to jog your memory:

## Example Data: Flights Departing New York City in 2013
Our data set is a table data frame (or `tibble`) of measurements on all flights departing the Greater New York City area in 2013. It has 336,776 unique flights and 19 measurements on those flights. We will use this data set to explore a few of the more commonly-used `dplyr` functions.
```{r install_flights, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
```
```{r head_flights}
library(nycflights13)
flights
```


## Overview of Common Functions
These functions all operate on tidy data frames:

- `filter()`: return rows that match a certain set of conditions
- `arrange()`: sort rows by a given set of measurements
- `select()`: select, rename, and / or reorder columns
- `mutate()`: create new columns (often as functions of your existing columns)
- `group_by()`: group rows by chosen columns
- `summarise()`: collapse multiple rows into one (often paired with `group_by()` for group summaries)

All of these functions have very similar syntax: `function(data_df, ...)`. The ellipsis will take in the additional conditions or arguments for the function, and column names are passed unquoted. Additionally, these functions **do not** create new data objects. If you want to keep the transformed data table you've created, you **must** store it as an object.



*******************************************************************************

</br>

# Subset Rows with `filter()`
The filter function takes in the data frame and a logical argument. Rows that return `TRUE` for that logical argument are returned as a subset of the original data frame. For example, we would like to inspect only flights that happened on 1 January, 2013.
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
This code selects the 842 rows of the `flights` data frame where the `month` column is equal to the number 1 (for January) and the `day` column is also equal to 1.


## R Basics Refresher
### Side Note: Comparing Values
In order to check if the values in the `month` column were equal to the number 1, we needed a comparison function for the equality of two objects. In `R`, we have the following simple comparison tools for integers and real numbers:
```{r compareAB}
A <- 2
B <- 3
A > B  # A greater than B?
A >= B # A greater than or equal to B?
A < B  # A less than B?
A <= B # A less than or equal to B?
A == B # A equal to B?
A != B # A not equal to B?
```

Notice that comparing equality requires two equal signs, not one.


### Side Note: Missing Values in `R`
Missing values in `R` are represented by `NA`: not `-999`, `?`, `" "`, or even `NaN`. When you import any data into `R`, pay attention to the missing value codes from other data analysis software. `R` treats missing values (the `NA`s) as a statement saying "I don't know". Also, understand that missing values are "contagious" in `R`. Here are some examples:
```{r}
NA < 3    # Is something I don't know less than 3? I don't know.
NA * 2    # What is "I don't know" multiplied by 2? I don't know.
NA & TRUE # Are these both TRUE? I don't know.
NA | TRUE # Are either of these TRUE? Yes, one of them is TRUE.
NA == NA  # Is something I don't know equal to something else I don't know? I don't know.
is.na(NA) # Is this something we don't know? Yes.
```


### Side Note: Logical Operators
There are three logical operators we will commonly employ: AND, OR, and NOT.
```{r compareLogicals}
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
x | y # Are either x or y TRUE?
x & y # Are both x and y TRUE?
!x    # What is the opposite of x?
```

Here is a nice picture (shamelessly borrowed from *R for Data Science*).
![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/transform-logical.png)

There are two more operators to think about, but they are shorthands for the primary three.
```{r}
# The XOR operator:
(x | y) & !(x & y) # are x or y TRUE, but not both?
xor(x, y)

# The Set Membership operator
A == 1 | A == 2 | A == 3
A %in% c(1, 2, 3)
```


## Examples
1. Find all the flights on Christmas Eve.
We'll use the *pipe operator* from last session, but the code is exactly the same as the code for finding all the New Year's Day flights.
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 12, day == 24)
```
As a review, the pipe turns `x %>% f(y)` into `f(x, y)`. Pipes allow us to read code from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, rather than inside out with a giant nest of parentheses.

2. Find all flights during the summer months (June, July, and August).
```{r}
filter(flights, month %in% c(6, 7, 8))
```
3. Find all flights that did *not* depart from Newark Liberty.
```{r}
filter(flights, origin != "EWR")
```
4. Find all JetBlue ("B6") or Southwest ("WN") flights.
```{r}
filter(flights, carrier == "B6" | carrier == "WN")
```
5. Find any flights out of LaGuardia that actually left on time.
```{r}
filter(flights, origin == "LGA" & dep_delay <= 0)
```



*******************************************************************************

</br>

# Sort Rows with `arrange()`
The `arrange()` function takes in a data frame and a set of columns to sort on. We can sort the flights by in increasing order by the day of the year: we sort by month, then by day within month.
```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

Also, we can sort the flights by departure delay time.
```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

Further, we can combine this with the `filter()` commmand to sort the American Airlines flights out of JFK on the day before Thanksgiving by their duration. By the way, see how easy it is to chain rather complicated commands together? You might begin to imagine that we are only scratching the surface of what we can do with `dplyr`...
```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(carrier == "AA") %>% 
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>% 
  filter(month == 11) %>% 
  filter(day == 27) %>%
  arrange(desc(air_time))
```
As an aside, look how clean this code looks because of our pipes! Imagine trying to write this as a set of nested functions. Not pretty.



*******************************************************************************

</br>

# Select and Move Columns with `select()`
While `filter()` and `arrange()` help us select and sort individual observations (rows), the `select()` function helps us select, rename, or reorder the measurements (columns) of a data frame.


## Select Columns that Meet Our Criteria
We first select three columns specifically by their names.
```{r}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```
Notice that we only have the three columns we explicitly requested by name *and no more*. The `select()` function will drop whatever we don't ask for by default, but we can change this behaviour by adding the additional `everything()` argument (we'll come back to this in the "reordering columns" section).

We could have also specified a range of column names to achieve the same effect.
```{r}
select(flights, year:day)
```

If you have used regular expressions or performed string manipulation before, you can also use the following modifiers to the `select()` function:

1. Find all the columns with names starting with "dep_".
```{r}
select(flights, starts_with("dep_"))
```
2. Find all the columns with names ending with "ay".
```{r}
select(flights, ends_with("ay"))
```
3. Find all the columns with names that contain "time".
```{r}
select(flights, contains("time"))
```
4. Find all the columns with names that start with exactly three lower case letters followed by "_".
```{r}
select(flights, matches("^[a-z]{3}\\_"))
```
 The `matches()` function takes in a *regular expression*. If you have never used regular expressions for string queries before, don't be afraid. You can do most of the things you need without ever touching the `matches()` function. However, if you do find yourself needing some help with string manipulation in `R`, please see the `stringr` package cheat sheet from the [RStudio Cheat Sheets page](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) and [the strings chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#strings) from *R for Data Science*.


## Remove, Reorder, or Rename
### Remove Columns
We can also use "negative indexing" to select all the columns *except* for the columns we named.
```{r}
select(flights, -(year:day))
```
This is particularly useful when we have filtered out all of one type of observation. We can then remove the redundant column information. For instance, previously we filtered only the flights leaving on 1 January, 2013. However, we still had the `year`, `month`, and `day` columns in this data table, even though this information was superfluous after filtering.
```{r}
# Before
flights %>%
  filter(month == 1, day == 1)

# After
flights %>%
  filter(month == 1, day == 1) %>% 
  select(-year, -month, -day)
```


### Reorder Columns
As we alluded to above, we can also use the `select()` function to change the order of the columns of the data table, *without removing the columns we don't explicitely name*, with the helpof the `everything()` function.
```{r}
select(flights, time_hour, air_time, everything())
```

### Rename Columns
While the `select()` function *can* rename columns, we recommend using the `rename()` function for better readibility of your code instead. This function takes in the data table and an argument that follows the `[new name] = [old name]` syntax. For example, we notice that all of the column names with more than one word are written in `snake_case` except for `tailnum`. We can rename this column to match our naming convention. **However, we *must* save the results of the output of the `rename()` function. Otherwise, the data table with the new column name will print to the screen but never be saved anywhere.** We can use the `names()` function to check that our new name stuck.
```{r}
flights <- rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
names(flights)
```



*******************************************************************************

</br>

# Create New Columns with `mutate()`
Up to this point, we have only teased out observational or measurement information that was already in the data table. But what if we want to create a new measurement as a function of some existing measurements? We can do so with the `mutate()` function. This function's syntax is very similar to the syntax of the `rename()` function: the data frame is first, then `[new column name] = [expression]`.

For example, we will find all the continental US flights with the strongest potential jet stream delay (the West Coast airports). We would like to find the land speed of each of these flights and add it to our smaller data table.
```{r}
westCoast <- c("BUR", "HNL", "LAS", "LAX", "OAK", "PDX", "PHX", "PSP", "RNO",
               "SAN", "SEA", "SFO", "SJC", "SLC")
jetStreamFlights <- flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% westCoast) %>% 
  select(month, day, dest, ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time)

jetStreamFlights %>% 
  mutate(speed_mph = distance / (air_time / 60))
```

If we only care about the speeds themselves, we can select the `speed_mph` column we just created.
```{r}
jetStreamFlights %>% 
  mutate(speed_mph = distance / (air_time / 60)) %>% 
  select(speed_mph)
```
Alternatively, we could use `mutate()`'s "cousin", the `transmute()` function. This function is shorthand for `mutate` then `select`.
```{r}
jetStreamFlights %>% 
  transmute(speed_mph = distance / (air_time / 60))
```


The possible uses of the `mutate()` function are practically endless, but we can look a few examples.

1. The departure and arrival times are presented in a readable form of hours as the first two digits and and minutes as the last two (for example, 5:17AM is `517`). However, we can't subtract arrival time from departure time because these times are not proper continuous variables. We can create two new columns which measure the number of minutes after midnight for both departure and arrival (using modular arithmetic). We will then move these columns to the front so we can see them.
```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(dep_time_min = (dep_time %/% 100) * 60 + dep_time %% 100,
         arr_time_min = (arr_time %/% 100) * 60 + arr_time %% 100) %>% 
  select(starts_with("dep_time"), starts_with("arr_time"), everything())
```
The `%%` operator is the [*modulo* operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) (sometimes called the "remainder" operator) in `R`. The `a %% b` operation returns the remainder after dividing `a` by `b`. The `%/%` operator is the [*integer division* operator](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntegerDivision.html); the `a %/% b` operation returns the quotient of `a` and `b` with any decimal information discarded.

2. We may not be concerned with the actual distance of a flight, but perhaps its difference from the average flight distance.
```{r}
flights %>% 
  transmute(residual_dist = distance - mean(distance))
```

3. We want to add an indicator for "long flights" (American Airlines considers a long flight any flight over four-and-a-half hours) and then order these flights by flight time, excluding flights to Honolulu.
```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(long_flight = air_time >= 270) %>% 
  filter(dest != "HNL") %>% 
  select(dest, long_flight, air_time, everything()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(air_time))
```

# Grouping and Group Summaries with `group_by()` and `summarise()`
The `summarise()` function is very powerful and very flexible. We will not have time to discuss all it can do. For a more complete discussion, see [the `summarise()` section](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouped-summaries-with-summarise) of *R for Data Science*, chapter 5.

The syntax of `summarise()` is similar to the `mutate()` syntax. We can find the average delay of all flights leaving the New York City area in 2013. Because `NA`s are contagious, we remove them from the calculation with `na.rm = TRUE`.
```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
Incidentally, the `NA`s are from cancelled flights. We can remove the cancelled flights and save this data set.
```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay))
```

We can also find the arrival delay by destination with `group_by()`, then check if any cites seem to have less arrival delays (possibly due to changes in wind resistance).
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>% 
  mutate(resid_delay = delay - mean(delay)) %>% 
  arrange(resid_delay)
```
We can always ungroup our data table with the `ungroup()` function.


## Chaining Operations Together
We have already used the pipe (` %>% `) operator quite a bit. This allows us to chain multiple steps together. For example, we might want to plot the relationship between flight distance and arrival delay (if you don't remember how to use `ggplot()`, take a look at the Review section).
```{r}
# Create a "delays" data table
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  # We don't want any small airports, or Honolulu
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")

# Plot the delays and add a smoother
ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

## Adding and Visualising Counts
Let's look at the average delay by plane. Based on this graph, there are some planes with an *average* delay of over five hours! But how many flights did that plane make? We need to add a count.
```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tail_num) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay)
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = delay)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 10)
```

Now that we add a count and re-plot the average arrival delay, we immediately see the Central Limit Theorem in action. All those planes with massive average delays only had one or two flights.
```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tail_num) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```

We can remove any planes with fewer than 30 flights and re-visualize the relationships between average delay and number of flights and the overall count-delay distribution.
```{r}
delays %>% 
  filter(n >= 30) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 1/10)

delays %>% 
  filter(n >= 30) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = delay)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 10)

```


## Other Useful Summaries
We know that passengers don't usually complain if their flight is early, but our `dep_delay` has negative values for flights which left early. We can find the average true "delay" by taking the summary of only the positive delay values.
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_delay1 = mean(arr_delay),
    avg_delay2 = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay > 0]) # the average positive delay
  )
```

### Side Note: Logical Subsetting
Recall our "`R` Basics" session: you can subset a vector by using square brackets. Thus, `x[2]` means "show me the second element of `x`". Let's see an example; we'll create a vector of the first 10 integers:
```{r}
x <- 1:10
x[2]
```
We can also subset this vector by a logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) vector of the same length.
```{r}
(logi <- rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5))
x[logi]

x > 5
x[x > 5]
```
Therefore, `mean(vec[vec > 0])` will take the average of all the values in a vector that are positive.

### Examples
1. We can find the proportion of flights by day that are delayed longer than 1 hour.
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(hour_perc = mean(arr_delay > 60))
```

2. We can also measure parametric and non-parametric spread or variability.
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(distance_sd = sd(distance)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance_sd))

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    first = min(dep_time),
    p25 = quantile(dep_time, 0.25),
    last = max(dep_time)
  )
```

3. Because counting by groups is so common, we can use the shorthand `count()` function.
```{r}
# Instead of 
not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
# use
not_cancelled %>% 
  count(dest)
```

4. The `count()` function can take in weights as well. We can use this to find the planes that logged the most air miles in 2013.
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  count(tail_num, wt = distance) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```


## Grouping by Multiple Variables
We can group on the year, month within year, and day within month. Then, we can "roll up" the data summaries.
```{r}
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
per_day <- summarise(daily, flights = n())
per_day

per_month <- summarise(per_day, flights = sum(flights))
per_month

(per_year  <- summarise(per_month, flights = sum(flights)))
```


*******************************************************************************

</br>

# Optional: Merge Data Tables with `*_join()`
If you have two or more tables which share one or more columns, then you can join these tables using the `*_join()` family of functions. For two data tables `A` and `B` with a shared column named `"x"`, these functions are

- `left_join(A, B, by = "x")`: join matching rows from `B` to `A`. Missing rows in `B` will be padded with `NA`.
- `right_join(A, B, by = "x")`: join matching rows from `A` to `B`. Missing rows in `A` will be padded with `NA`.
- `inner_join(A, B, by = "x")`: join rows only in both `A` and `B`. There will be no missing rows.
- `full_join(A, B, by = "x")`: join all rows in `A` and `B`. Missing rows in `A` and `B` will be padded with `NA`.
- `semi_join(A, B, by = "x")`: retain rows in `A` which have a match in `B`.
- `anti_join(A, B, by = "x")`: retain rows in `A` which do not have a match in `B`.

# A Comment on Importing Data with `readr`
When you use the RStudio IDE, you have access to a point-and-click data import guide for data files in many different forms. Such forms include tab-seperated, fixed-width, .csv, Stata, SAS, SPSS, Excel, and many others. A word of caution: practice with the `read.fwf()`, `read.table`, and `read.csv` functions from the `base` package in `R`; then, you should practice importing the same data with the `read_fwf()`, `read_delim`, and `read_csv` functions from the `readr` package. Once you are familiar with how the `base` and `readr` functions are different, then you can start using the `readr` functions from a script instead of using the point-and-click RStudio IDE importing steps. 

If you have never imported data before, please ask for help. Also, read [this chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/import.html) on importing data from a variety of sources. I have seen many problems in code because a tiny little peice of data was imported incorrectly, and this mistake wormed its way through an entire analysis. Don't let this happen to you. Ask the [BBSR Core](http://sylvester.org/shared-resources/biostatistics-and-bioinformatics/bbc-administration) for help.
